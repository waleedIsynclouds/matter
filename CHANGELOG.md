## 0.0.8

### New Features
- **ICD (Intermittently Connected Device) support** — Matter 1.2+
  - Added `ICDDeviceInfo` model class with all fields: `symmetricKey`, `userActiveModeTriggerHint`, `userActiveModeTriggerInstruction`, `icdNodeId`, `icdCounter`, `monitoredSubject`, `fabricId`, `fabricIndex`.
  - Added `onICDRegistrationComplete(int errorCode, ICDDeviceInfo? icdDeviceInfo)` to the `CompletionListener` interface — previously a TODO comment.
  - `ChipDeviceController.call()` now dispatches this callback with proper JSON decoding from the native side.
- **Thread network commissioning** — `NetworkCredentials` now supports Thread in addition to Wi-Fi:
  - New `ThreadCredentials` class wrapping a Thread Active Operational Dataset (`Uint8List operationalDataset`).
  - New named constructors `NetworkCredentials.wifi(WiFiCredentials)` and `NetworkCredentials.thread(ThreadCredentials)`.
  - Legacy `NetworkCredentials({required WiFiCredentials wifiCredentials})` constructor kept for backward compatibility.
  - `toJson()` correctly serialises whichever credential type is set. The Android native layer already parsed Thread credentials.
- **`setCompletionListener` is now public** — `Future<void> setCompletionListener(CompletionListener listener)` can now be called independently from `pairDevice`, allowing the listener to be assigned or swapped at any time.
- **`unPairDevice` is now fully active** — `Future<bool> unPairDevice(int nodeId)` removes a device from the fabric and was previously commented out. The Android native `/unPairDevice` route was already wired.

### Improvements
- **`DataVersionFilter` support in `subscribe()`** — The `dataVersionFilters` parameter is no longer ignored. Both the Dart method signature and the Android native layer now parse, pass, and forward the filter list to `subscribeToPath`, enabling efficient change-only subscriptions.
- **Additional public exports** — `ChipEventPath`, `DataVersionFilter`, and `ICDDeviceInfo` are now exported from `package:flutter_matter/flutter_matter.dart` so consumers can construct them directly without importing internal paths.
- **Android package rename** — Updated the Android plugin package/group/namespace from `com.zengge.flutter_matter` to `com.tyx.flutter_matter`.
- **Example lockfile handling** — Stopped tracking `example/pubspec.lock` and added it to `.gitignore` to avoid noisy example dependency lockfile diffs in plugin commits.

### Bug Fixes & Analysis Cleanup
- Fixed `eventPaths` parsing in iOS `subscribe()` and `readRequest()` so event path payloads are read from the correct request field.
- Expanded the Dart `subscribe()` / `read()` API docs and clarified that `dataVersionFilters` is currently supported on Android only.
- Removed unused imports: `dart:ffi` (controller.dart), `dart:collection` (node_state.dart), `dart:typed_data` (tlv_types.dart), `flutter/widgets.dart` (ble.dart), and several unused imports across the example app.
- Removed 7 unused `result` local variable assignments in `ble.dart` GATT handler methods.
- Fixed stale `@override` annotation on `onCloseBleComplete()` in the example app (method was removed from the `CompletionListener` interface).
- Fixed unnecessary non-null assertion (`!`) on `chipDeviceController` in `control_page.dart`.
- Replaced auto-generated stub test files (`plugin_integration_test.dart`, `widget_test.dart`) that referenced non-existent classes with minimal passing placeholder tests.
- Added `flutter_lints` as a dev dependency to the example app.
- Suppressed `unused_element` lint on the intentionally private `ChipPathId._` constructor.
